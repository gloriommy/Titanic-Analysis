# Titanic-Analysis
Titanic-Analysis.ipynb contains the result of data analysis on Kaggle's Titanic data. In the analysis following questions are answered:
1. Is there a difference in survival rate between male and female ?
2. Is there a difference between overall passenger survival rate and children(under 18) survival rate? If so, are girls (under 18) more likely to survive than boys (under 18)?
3. Do survival rates vary among the three passenger classes (1st, 2nd, and 3rd)?
4. Do survival rates vary among passengers who boarded from different ports (Cherbourg, Queenstown, and Southampton)? If so, what is causing the difference?
